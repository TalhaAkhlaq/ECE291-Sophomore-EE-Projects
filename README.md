# Sophomore EE Projects

This repository contains coursework and projects from the ECE-291: Sophomore Electrical Engineering Projects course, focusing on constructing and analyzing a Theremin circuit. This course provides hands-on experience in electrical engineering principles such as circuit design, signal processing, and analog systems.

## Course Overview

The course explores the following concepts:

- **Electrical Engineering Principles**: Frequency response, noise, feedback, loading, and interfacing.
- **Analog Circuit Design**: Construction and testing of oscillators, filters, amplifiers, rectifiers, and comparators.
- **Signal Processing**: Principles such as heterodyning, envelope detection, and frequency modulation.
- **Systems Engineering**: Development of a testbench and documentation for a complete system.
- **Lab Instrumentation**: Use of oscilloscopes, multimeters, and function generators to analyze and debug circuits.

## Project Description and Overview

### Theremin

The primary project of this course involved the construction of a Theremin circuit, which operates on the principle of frequency modulation. The proximity of the player's hand to an antenna changes the system's capacitance, impacting the frequency of oscillators. By combining signals from variable and fixed oscillators, the circuit generates an audible beat frequency.

Key Components:
- **Oscillators and Filters**: Generate and refine the signal for audio output.
- **Envelope Detectors and Amplifiers**: Extract and amplify the amplitude envelope of the signal.
- **Voltage Dividers and DC Blocking Capacitors**: Stabilize the signal and remove noise.
